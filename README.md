# First Person Shooter in gawk

After seeing TheMozg's awkaster project I thought to myself (yet again) "I could make that better, right?".  
So during easter of 2020 I started programming and came up with this first result.

## Controls
key | action
--- | -------------------
**w**/**s** | forward/backward
**a**/**d** | strafe left/right
**j**/**l** | turn left/right
**TAB** | move minimap
**~** | toggle shading 
**ESC** | quit

## Showcase
Here's a static image of the result:
